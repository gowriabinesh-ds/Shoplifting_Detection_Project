# 🚨 Shoplifting Detection System
### Real-Time AI-Powered CCTV Analysis for UK Retail Security

---

## 📌 Overview

UK retailers lose **£4.7 billion annually** to shoplifting. Traditional CCTV systems only record — they don't watch. Staff cannot monitor every aisle, and UK law limits physical intervention.

This project builds an **end-to-end deep learning pipeline** that:
- Analyses CCTV footage in real time using a 3D convolutional neural network
- Detects shoplifting behaviour (concealment gestures) across video frames
- Triggers an **instant audio alarm** when high-confidence detection occurs
- Serves predictions through a **live REST API dashboard**
- Saves evidence clips automatically for security review

> **Test Result:** 86.1% confidence detection on real UCF-Crime surveillance footage · 80% overall test accuracy

## 🎯 Demo

| Normal Activity | Shoplifting Detected |
|----------------|---------------------|
| ✅ Green label — no alarm | 🚨 Red label — beep alarm fires |
| Confidence bar low | Confidence bar fills red |
| Alert: `false` | Alert: `true` — evidence clip saved |

**API Response Example:**
```json
{
  "label": "shoplifting",
  "confidence": 0.861,
  "prob_normal": 0.139,
  "prob_shoplifting": 0.861,
  "alert": true,
  "filename": "Shoplifting001_x264.mp4"
}
```

**Why R3D-18?**
- 3D convolutions process **time AND space** simultaneously — understands motion, not just static frames
- Pretrained on **Kinetics-400** (400 human action classes) — motion priors transfer directly to shoplifting gestures
- Transfer learning allows strong performance with only 100 training clips
- Production-friendly — exportable to ONNX, runs on CPU

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gowriabinesh-ds/Shoplifting_Detection_Project.git
cd Shoplifting_Detection_Project
```

### 2. Create Conda Environment
```bash
conda create -n shoplifting python=3.11
conda activate shoplifting
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download Dataset
The `data/` folder is not included in this repository due to file size.

Register (free) and download from: [UCF-Crime Dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/research/real-world-anomaly-detection/)

Download these two files only:
- `Anomaly-Videos-Part-4.zip` → extract and copy the `Shoplifting/` subfolder
- `Normal_Videos_for_Event_Recognition.zip` → extract the normal clips

Place them in your project like this:
```
data/raw/Shoplifting/    ← 50 shoplifting clips
data/raw/Normal/         ← 50 normal clips
```

### 5. Run the Pipeline

> **Note:** Navigate into the scripts folder first, then run each step in order.

```bash
cd scripts

# Step 2 — Extract 16 frames per clip + CLAHE contrast enhancement
python step2_preprocess.py

# Step 3 — Verify dataloader is working correctly
python step3_dataset_loader.py

# Step 4 — Verify model loads correctly
python step4_model.py

# Step 5 — Train the model (1-2 hours on CPU — leave running)
python step5_train.py

# Step 6 — Export trained model to ONNX and TorchScript
python step6_export_model.py

# Step 7 — Run live inference on webcam
python step7_inference.py
```

### 6. Launch the Web App
```bash
uvicorn step8_app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Then open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8000

## ⚠️ Limitations

| Limitation | Severity | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Small dataset (100 clips) | High | Production systems need 500+ clips per class |
| CPU training only | Medium | GPU would allow VideoSwin Transformer |
| 22% false positive rate | Medium | Would reduce with more diverse training data |
| Single camera stream | Medium | Real deployment needs multi-camera support |
| Domain shift on compressed video | Medium | WhatsApp-compressed footage reduces accuracy |
| No GDPR compliance layer | Low | Required for UK production deployment |

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Add Stealing class from UCF-Crime to increase training data to ~150 clips
- [ ] Integrate DCSASS dataset for additional theft footage diversity
- [ ] Upgrade to VideoSwin Transformer with GPU access for higher accuracy
- [ ] Build multi-camera async inference queue
- [ ] Implement GDPR-compliant pipeline (ICO guidelines — 30-day retention)
- [ ] Deploy on NVIDIA Jetson edge device for on-premise inference
- [ ] Add precision-recall threshold tuning to reduce false positive rate
- [ ] Integrate with store staff mobile alert system
